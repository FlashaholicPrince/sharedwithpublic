Has anyone faced such issue?

I created a custom policy using the maven archetype. Deployed the policy to exchange.
In exchange i can see the new custom policy.
When i go to API Manager, i am able to see the custom Policy inside the Automated Policies Section. But the custom policy is NOT VISIBLE under API Level Policies.

Im using a developer trial account, below is my custom policy zip file
